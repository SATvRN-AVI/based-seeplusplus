#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int counter;
    int variable_1, account_balace, invoices;

    counter = 1;

    int variable = 1;

    int twosquared = 2 * 2;

    result = 100 + 200;

    x = x + 1;



}

/* 
Above is some practice with variables and integers and the assignment
of values. On lines 6 and 7, we see a single integer declared with the
name, "counter", and 3 integers declared in a single line declaration.

Below that, we see that counter has been assigned the value of 1.

We see on line 11 a new integer named "variable" assigned to the 1
on the same line, rather than using two.

On line 13 we declare an integer "twosquared" and assign it the value
of 2 multiplied by 2. 

On line 15, we see the variable "result" and set it equal to the sum
of 100 plus 200. 

On line 17 we see a variable "x" assigned the value of itself, plus
1. This is useful for creating a counting sequence.

/* 
Special note on Keywords! Keywords are words within the C++ syntax that
perform a tasks or have values already assigned to them within the code.
for example, you can't declare an int named "int", you could however,
declare an integer named "Int" as C++ is case sensitive. However, this
is considered incorrect, so it would be better for us to instead write
"int_value" to differentiate.
